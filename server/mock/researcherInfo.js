    'biography': 'Ali Emadi (S’98–M’00–SM’03–F’13) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees (Hons.) from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2000, all in electrical engineering. He was the Harris Perlstein Endowed Chair Professor of engineering and the Director of the Electric Power and Power Electronics Center and Grainger Laboratories, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA, where he established research and teaching facilities, as well as courses in power electronics, motor drives, and vehicular power systems. He was the Founder, the Chairman, and the President of Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technologies, Inc., (HEVT), a university spin-off company of Illinois Tech. He is currently the Canada Excellence Research Chair Laureate of McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. He holds the NSERC/FCA Industrial Research Chair in Electrified Powertrains and the Tier I Canada Research Chair of Transportation Electrification and Smart Mobility. He is also the principal author or coauthor of more than 450 journal and conference articles as well as several books, including Vehicular Electric Power Systems (2003), Energy-Efficient Electric Motors (2004), Uninterruptible Power Supplies and Active Filters (2004), Modern Electric, Hybrid Electric, and Fuel Cell Vehicles (Second Edition, 2009), and Integrated Power Electronic Converters and Digital Control (2009). He was a recipient of numerous awards and recognitions including the GM Best Engineered Hybrid System Award at Illinois Tech and McMaster University, in 2010, 2013, and 2015 competitions. He was an Advisor for the Formula Hybrid Teams at Illinois Tech and McMaster University. He was the Inaugural General Chair of the 2012 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo (ITEC). He has chaired the several IEEE and SAE conferences in the areas of vehicle power and propulsion. He is an Editor of the Handbook of Automotive Power Electronics and Motor Drives (2005) and Advanced Electric Drive Vehicles (2014). He is also a Co-Editor of the Switched Reluctance Motor Drives (2018). He is also the founding Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification.
